# Test configuration for FlutterReflect MCP Server

# Test order: run tests that don't need Flutter app first
# Then run tests that auto-spawn the app
testpaths = tests

# Show output during tests
addopts = -v --tb=short -s

# Register custom markers
markers =
    no_flutter_app: Tests that don't require Flutter app (run first)
    requires_flutter_app: Tests that require Flutter app (auto-spawned)

# Run tests in specific order (alphabetically by default, but class order matters)
# TestDisconnectWithoutApp runs before TestConnectTool due to alphabetical ordering
